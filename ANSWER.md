# CI/CD
CI/CD is an acronym that stands for Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (or Continuous Delivery). It refers to a set of practices and tools used by software development teams to automate and streamline the process of building, testing, and deploying software applications.
Continuous Integration (CI) is the process of continuously merging code changes from multiple developers into a single shared repository. 
This process involves automatically building and testing the code changes as soon as they are committed to the repository, to detect and address any integration issues early on. This allows developers to catch and fix errors quickly, reducing the likelihood of bugs and improving the overall quality of the code.
Continuous Deployment (CD) or Continuous Delivery (CD) is the practice of automatically deploying code changes to production environments, after they have passed through the testing and approval stages. With CD, developers can quickly and reliably deliver new features and updates to users, while ensuring the stability and performance of the application.
The CI/CD process typically involves using various tools and technologies, such as version control systems (e.g. Git), build automation tools (e.g. Jenkins, Travis CI), testing frameworks (e.g. JUnit, Selenium), and containerization platforms (e.g. Docker, Kubernetes), among others. By automating the entire software delivery process, CI/CD helps teams deliver higher quality software faster, with greater efficiency and reliability.

# ADVANTAGES OF CIRCLE CI
* Speed and reliability: CircleCI is known for its speed and reliability in building, testing, and deploying software applications. CircleCI's distributed architecture ensures that builds and tests are run in parallel, resulting in faster feedback cycles and shorter build times. CircleCI also provides a powerful caching mechanism that speeds up builds by storing the dependencies and artifacts that are frequently used in the build process. 
* Flexibility and customization: CircleCI provides a high degree of flexibility and customization, allowing developers to tailor their build and test workflows to meet their specific needs. CircleCI supports a wide range of programming languages, frameworks, and tools, and provides a rich set of configuration options that can be used to customize the build and test process. CircleCI altom build environments. 
* Enterprise-grade security: CircleCI provides enterprise-grade security features that are essential for large organizations that handle sensitive data. CircleCI supports SAML-based single sign-on (SSO), two-factor authentication (2FA), and fine-grained access controls that allow administrators to control who has access to sensitive data and workflows. CircleCI also provides integrations with popular security scanning tools, such as SonarQube and Checkmarx, that can be used to detect and prevent security vulnerabilities in the code.
